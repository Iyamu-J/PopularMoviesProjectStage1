# PopularMoviesProjectStage1
The app shows the user a list of movies. The user can sort the list by using most popular or most rated.
Selecting a movie poster shows the user a couple of details about the selected movie.

## Running The App
The app requires an API key from (https://www.themoviedb.org). You will need an account.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. 
You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. 
Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
After you've gotten the key, paste it in api_key.xml file located it in the res directory. You should be good to go.
